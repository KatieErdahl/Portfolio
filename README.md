# Portfolio
I created this portfolio to show my skills. 

I used multiple datasets to create this portfolio, so I have titled documents accordingly: "Document Name - Dataset Name". 

The Hotel Reviews dataset was my first project, the Best Western Reviews dataset is my ongoing project, and any other datasets are side projects meant to show different abilities. The Hotel Reviews and Best Western Reviews projects are accessible in different branches with only information from those projects in each branch.

Here are the abilities that each document showcases:

Cleaned Reviews - Hotel Reviews: Cleaning data in excel, with a sheet called changelog to see what changes were made between each version.

Review SQL - Hotel Reviews: Querying my tables (as I would query a database) in SQL using Microsoft Access. If the query is opened and the tab is right clicked, there is a dropdown menu from which SQL View can be selected.

Review Visualization - Hotel Reviews: Creating data visualizations in PowerBI. My personal favorite page is "Review Breakdown", as the visualization tool is interactive, so different areas of interest can be selected and broken down all the way to a single reviewer's negative review and positive review. 

Python Sentiment Analysis Code - Hotel Reviews: Natural language processing and performing accurate sentiment analysis on customer reviews.

Python Word Cloud Code - Hotel Reviews: Creating two word clouds, one from the positive reviews and one from the negative reviews. Removed stopwords and adjusted settings so that they looked right. The word clouds highlight keywords from each set of reviews, with more frequently occuring words being displayed in larger fonts.

Largest Guest Segments Visio - Hotel Reviews: Creating informative visualizations using Microsoft Visio.

KPI Dashboard - Sales Data: Creating data visualizations in Excel, there is a dropdown menu in cell G6 to select the Month-Year. The sheet will change to show the figures for that month.

Edgware Data Cleaned - Best Western Reviews: Cleaning data from Best Western Reviews dataset and storing data generated through python code, as well as using the new data to generate additional data to help with analysis.

Edgware Hotel Analysis - Best Western Reviews: Reporting actionable insights meant to improve the hotel's average score, created data visualizations in Excel and Visio.
