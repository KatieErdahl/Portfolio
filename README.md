The Hotel Reviews dataset was my first project.

Here are the abilities that each document showcases:

Cleaned Reviews: Cleaning data in excel, with a sheet called changelog to see what changes were made between each version.

Review SQL: Querying my tables (as I would query a database) in SQL using Microsoft Access. If the query is opened and the tab is right clicked, there is a dropdown menu from which SQL View can be selected.

Review Visualization: Creating data visualizations in PowerBI. My personal favorite page is "Review Breakdown", as the visualization tool is interactive, so different areas of interest can be selected and broken down all the way to a single reviewer's negative review and positive review. 

Python Sentiment Analysis Code: Natural language processing and performing accurate sentiment analysis on customer reviews.

Python Word Cloud Code: Creating two word clouds, one from the positive reviews and one from the negative reviews. Removed stopwords and adjusted settings so that they looked right. The word clouds highlight keywords from each set of reviews, with more frequently occuring words being displayed in larger fonts.

Largest Guest Segments Visio: Creating informative visualizations using Microsoft Visio.
